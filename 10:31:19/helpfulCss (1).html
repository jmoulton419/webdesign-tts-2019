		<h2>Common CSS Properties</h2>
		

	</div>


	<div>
		<h2>Floats</h2>

		<p>The float property can have one of the following values:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>left - The element floats to the left of its container</li>
			<li>right - The element floats to the right of its container</li>
			<li>none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default</li>
			<li>inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Positioning</h2>

		<p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</p>
		<p>There are five different position values:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>static</li>
			<li>relative</li>
			<li>fixed</li>
			<li>absolute</li>
			<li>sticky</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.</p>

		<h3>Static positioning</h3>
		<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. Setting top, bottom, left, or right properties do not affect a statically positioned element.</p>

		<h3>Relative positioning</h3>
		<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>

		<h3>Fixed positioning</h3>
		<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.</p>

		<h3>Absolute positioning</h3>
		<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</p>

		<h3>Sticky positioning</h3>
		<p>An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2>Z-Index</h2>
		<p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.</p>
		<p>An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.</p>
		<p>Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).</p>
