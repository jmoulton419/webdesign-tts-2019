	<!-- Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

	Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

	Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements. -->
